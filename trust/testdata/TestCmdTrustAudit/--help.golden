Perform an audit of the local trust store(s) and report any expected, missing,
or extra CA certificates per store. A set of expected CAs is fetched for the

and homebrew.

CA certificate states:

  * VALID:   an expected CA certificate is present in every trust store.
  * MISSING: an expected CA certificate is missing in one or more stores.
  * EXTRA:   an unexpected CA certificate is present in one or more stores.
